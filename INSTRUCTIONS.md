For this assignment, I want you to create a home page for your internet browsing. The home page should include:
  A Title for the webpage ex. "YOUR NAME's Homepage"
  Headings for each of the following three sections
    A brief description of you
    Links to 5 sites you visit often
    A picture you feel like represents your personality

See my example for more info: [Mr. Pierce's Homepage] (https://dabarbarian125.github.io/Homepage_example/)

# Connecting a project to Git
Click the second icon on the left sidebar.

Click create a Git Repo and login with the GitHub login in your email.

# Viewing your project on the web

Go to GitHub.com.

If you want to show your work (the project) to others, or submit a solution below, you will need to publish your site so that others can access it from the web, rather than just on your local machine. The good news is that if you have your project on GitHub (as described above) doing this is incredibly simple.

GitHub allows you to publish web projects directly from a GitHub repository. Doing this will allow you to access your project from your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name

There are a couple of ways to go about doing this, but the simplest is this:

    make sure that the main HTML file of your project is called index.html. If it is not, you will need to rename it.
    go to your GitHub repo on the web and click the Settings button
    scroll down until you find the GitHub Pages section
    change the Source from none to main branch and click Save.
    it may take a few minutes (the GitHub website says up to 10) but your project should be accessible over the web from your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name (obviously substituting your own details in the link)
